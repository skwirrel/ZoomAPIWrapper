ZoomAPIWrapper
==============

This is A simple PHP wrapper for calling the Zoom V2 API's. It aims to be
- Simple to use
- LIghtweight (no external dependencies)

What it Does Do
---------------

The class handles API authentication for you, as well as setting up the relevant curl options for the type of request you want to do.

What it Doesn't Do
------------------

*Compose body data for you*: When the endpoint your are calling requires the request body you are sending to include JSON data it is up to you to compose the required data (either as a PHP data structure or as a JSON data string)

*Handle pagination for you*: Most list endpoints support pagination of results. This wrapper doesn't automatically make multiple requests to get all the pages for you. If the results of your API call fills a page, then it is up to you to make another call for the next page of results (if you want the next page that is!).

Installing 
==========

Download ZoomAPIWrapper.php and require this in your code.

How to Get Your API Key
=======================

You need to go to the Zoom "App Marketplace", log in using your zoom account and then select "Build App" from the "Develop" dropdown menu. This link should take you there: https://marketplace.zoom.us/develop/create

Then you need to choose the *Server-to-Server OAuth app* option for "server-to-server integration". Once you fill out some basic information you will be taken to the "App Credentials" page which will give you the required information to use the API.

Usage
=====

To make a call to the API you need to know the following things:
- The HTTP request method (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- The path of the endpoint you want to call
- Any query parameters: query_paramater_array
- Any parameters that go into making up the path: path_parameter_array
- Any body content: request_body_array_or_string

All of these are nicely documented for you in the Zoom API Reference here:
https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api

    $zoom = ZoomAPIWrapper::init( '<your account id>', '<your client id>', '<your client secret>' );
  
    $response = $zoom->doRequest(<METHOD>, <endpoint_path> [,<query_parameter_array> [,<path_parameter_array> [,<request_body_array_or_string>] ] ]);
    // <endpoint_path> is the path exactly as given in the Zoom API reference (including curly braces) e.g. "/users/{userId}/assistants"
    // $response is false if there is a problem with the request e.g. endpoint_path includes a parameter which hasn't been specified in the path_parameter_array
    // N.B. Remember to test with '$response === false' as in some cases a successful call will result in an empty string for $response
    // If you want details of the nature of the problem with your request you can get an array of errors like this...
    if ( $response===false ) {
        $errors = $zoom->requestErrors();
    }

    // If there were no errors (i.e. $response!==false) you can still call requestErrors() - it will return an empty array

    // If the request goes ahead then $response will contain the decoded response from Zoom
  
    // If you want to know the HTTP response code you can get it like this...
    $httpResponse = $zoom->responseCode();

    // for subsequent calls within one hour the OAuth token can be stored and reused:

    $token = $zoom->getOAuthToken();

    // and later:

    $zoom = ZoomAPIWrapper::withToken(  $token );

TODO
====

There may be other things I haven't encountered yet, but the main one I'm aware of is lack of support for file uploads as required by /users/{userId}/picture
